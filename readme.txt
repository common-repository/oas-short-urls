== Description ==

OAS Short URLs is an internal link shortening service which uses the unique ID associated with each post/page as the reference.

So, OAS Short URLs lets you link to example.com/123, for example, and users will be redirected to the permalink of the post/page holding ID 123.

Note: OAS Short URLs will not work if the permalink settings is set to "default", but then why would you find this useful if it was?
